# port-killer-for-nodejs
this is a shell script to kills port conflict when we start node/nodemon server. it's automatically run nodemon server, but you
have to install nodemon previously or just edit the command directly script

run this script with following command:
./run {your nodejs port}
example:
./run 400

note : this script just compatible with linux machine. thanks
